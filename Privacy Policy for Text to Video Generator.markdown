# Privacy Policy for Text to Video Generator

**Effective Date**: April 22, 2025

Thank you for using the **Text to Video Generator** Chrome extension ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use the Extension. Your privacy is important to ke, and I am committed to transparency about my data practices.

## 1. Data I Collect

The Extension collects the following data:

- **User-Input Text**: Text you enter in the Extension’s popup interface to generate videos.
- **Generated Content**: Video data, generation states, and logs created during the video generation process.
- **Local Storage Data**: Temporary data stored on your device using Chrome’s Storage API, such as generated videos and progress information.

The Extension does **not** collect personal information (e.g., name, email, or browsing history) unless explicitly provided by you in the input text.

## 2. How I Use Your Data

I use the collected data to:

- Process your input text to generate videos, including audio narration, images, and captions.
- Store video data and generation states locally on your device to enable seamless continuation across sessions.
- Send your input text to our secure backend server for video generation.
- Improve the Extension’s functionality through anonymized logs (e.g., error tracking).

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **Local Storage**: Video data, generation states, and logs are stored on your device using Chrome’s Storage API. You can clear this data by clicking the “New Generation” or “Retry” buttons in the Extension’s interface, which removes stored data.
- **Backend Storage**: Input text and temporary files (e.g., audio, images) are processed on our backend server and deleted immediately after video generation. No user data is retained on the server beyond the duration of the request.
- **Retention Period**: Locally stored data persists until you clear it or uninstall the Extension. Backend data is not retained post-processing.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Extension uses the following third-party services to generate videos. Your input text may be sent to these services via my backend:

- **ElevenLabs**: For audio narration. 
- **Murf**: For fallback audio generation. 
- **AssemblyAI**: For audio transcription and timing analysis. 
- **Google Gemini**: For phrase extraction and image generation. 

These services are bound by their respective privacy policies, and I ensure they receive only the minimum data necessary for video generation.

## 5. Data Sharing

I do **not** share your data with any parties other than the third-party services listed above, which are used solely to provide the Extension’s functionality. No data is sold, traded, or used for advertising purposes.

## 6. Security Measures

I take the following steps to protect your data:

- All communication between the Extension and our backend uses secure HTTPS protocols.
- API keys for third-party services are stored securely on the backend, not in the Extension’s client-side code.
- Temporary files on the backend are deleted immediately after processing.
- No personal identifiers are collected or stored beyond the input text you provide.

## 7. Your Rights

You have control over your data:

- **Clear Data**: Use the “New Generation” or “Retry” buttons to remove stored video data and logs from your device.
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalling the Extension removes all locally stored data.
- **Review Input**: Be mindful of the text you input, as it is processed by third-party services for video generation.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the Extension’s functionality or legal requirements. The latest version will be available at [Privacy-Policy](https://github.com/TEJAS07080/Privacy-Policy/edit/main/Privacy%20Policy%20for%20Text%20to%20Video%20Generator.markdown) or within the Extension. The effective date will be updated accordingly.
